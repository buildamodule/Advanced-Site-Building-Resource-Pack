"Advanced Site Building in Drupal 7" Resource Pack
===================================================

This is the collection of files that are used in the "Advanced Site Building in Drupal 7" collection on [BuildAModule](http://buildamodule.com). In this collection we go through some fun, practical examples of using some of Drupal's most powerful modules including Views, Panels, Feeds and more. We also discuss:

* How to use Display Suite to create custom view modes
* How to use relationships in Views for complex content displays
* How to use Panels to create a page layout
* How the different layout modules compare

Many of the files here use a custom '.step' extension, which are referred to as 'step files'. This convention allows you to open all of the files in the editor of your choice, allows us to make hidden files visible, and makes it clear that the name of the step file is not the name of the final file that you will be using.

Enjoy!
